# Prestige-University-Library-Catalog
Source code for Advanced Data Structures
Introduction: 

Prestige University’s library is lacking academic materials, and there’s been a backlog of books, DVDs, and other materials at the top research library in the country. The library staff are struggling to register and shelve these materials at an equal rate that they are being borrowed and brought to the library. Titles are missing from their database; some are missing publishing dates and other information.  Our job is to create software that can resolve the backlog issue between the library and logistics. 

Specific Details: 
Our program needs to handle an unknown number of library items that need to be registered 
We need to store the titles, publish dates, authors, and subjects. 
We need to categorize between CDs, records, movies, books, articles,  
We need to be able to add new books/ materials, remove missing titles or recalled titles, and alphabetize the entries. 
We will also need to check if the item is available or not (checked out?) 

Assumptions: 
For this project, we will assume that... 
There are no duplicate titles nor duplicate entries 
We will not include edition numbers for the books 
Each item has a unique identification, date, and category 
Items can only be checked out or available (no holds) 
Titles and authors are not unique (multiple books by the same author) 
We will not organize by genre 
Our library catalog will only hold one copy of each book
